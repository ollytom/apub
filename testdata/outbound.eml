Absolutely. Memory-safe languages have been around for decades. The
reason there is so much poor code - including ones with manual memory
management bugs - out there is not a technical problem. There are
hordes and hordes of programmers, managers, companies etc. who would
love to get paid to port this stuff. They'll do it for 10% of the
price those stupid lumbering tech consultancies do it for.

But who gets the contracts in the end?
Give me a f'ing break!
